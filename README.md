# CSS Box Model

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of the CSS Box Model, which is a crucial concept in web design and development. The box model allows you to understand how elements are structured and spaced on a webpage, including the content area, padding, borders, and margins.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Content**: The actual content of the element, such as text or an image.
- **Padding**: The space between the content and the border, which adds extra space within the element.
- **Border**: The line surrounding the padding (if any) and content.
- **Margin**: The space outside the border, which separates the element from others.
